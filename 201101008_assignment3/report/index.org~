* QUESTION-WISE REPORT
** PROBLEM 1
   In this problem , I have first read number of rows and columns of first matrix
and then read elements of it row by row.Similarly for the second matrix and
then multiplied them without using for loop using _map_ and _reduce_ and appended 
final obtained matrix in a list and printed the list accordingly in matrix format
using the function _pr_ and  the map function. The _pr_ function prints the
element of list with a newline if it is last element of a row else it is 
printing that element with a space only.

** PROBLEM 2
   In this problem , I used _os_ library.  _os.walk_ module is used to go inside
the given directory recursively.Variable _si_ is used to calculate the size of
folder. _filename_ will give names of file and now using _os.join_ we concatenate
its path with the path of root and use _getsize_ to calculate its size and opened
it to read its contents and appended them to other file.Similarly is for dir.In 
the last,we divided the sizes by 1024*1024 to get size in MB.a will give me the
size of final file in which appending is done and si will give me the size of
the directory. 

** PROBLEM 3
   In this problem , I appended the given _csv_ file to a list and then made 2
new list out of it. _li2_ stores first column and _li1_ stores second column.Now using
reduce and filter I calculated the sum of elements of li1 which are greater than 
the given number and using reduce calculated the sum of all elements of li2 and
printed them.

** PROBLEM 4
   In this problem, the function _checkpat_ will return all the patterns which contains
the alphabets given by us in "word to be checked". _dic_ will be like  the dictionary.
 _level1_ function return us the word after either deleting a
letter from the given word or inserting a new letter or swapping positions of
2 letters or replacing a letter with other letter.The function _yes(w)_ will 
check whether the word is in dictionary or not. _level2(w)_ will make 2 level
of change to the given word. and similarly _level3(w)_ will make 3 level change.
Now finally in _check(w)_ will print the requisite message if the given word 
is in dictionary else it will give 5 nearest word of the given word.
